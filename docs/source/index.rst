Lopt Documentation
==================

lopt is a utility package that can generate mock Solidity contracts in the form of :code:`fakes` and :code:`mocks`.

Some benefits
-------------

* Sweet set of chai matchers,
* Typescript compatible,
* Typechain support,
* Fully tested,
* Well documented,
* Mock and assert contract calls,
* Preprogram returns and reverts,
* And more...

Why the name lopt?
------------------

Loki's alternative name is Lopt, and Loki was obviously taken.

Loki is the God of Mischief, a trickster, and the purpose of mocking libraries is basically to trick the tests.
